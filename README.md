The Gliss
=========

Description
-----------

The Gliss is a music review website, powered by Jekyll. We write reviews for music of all kinds, and occasionally write opinion pieces too. We mainly do this for fun, but also with the notion that someone is listening in, the reader. We’ll attempt to write these fairly consistently but we're not the powerhouse that a site like pitchfork is, expect updates every other day or so, but come by often to see if that changes.<p>

Although we’re primarily a music review site, we like to talk about the music scene and certain topics related to music. Usually we’ll try to do one each week but that could change as time goes on and new seasons approach.

You can contact us through the contact page, we’ll get back to you as quickly as we can.

Enjoy your time here at The Gliss.
