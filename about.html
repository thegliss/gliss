<p>Welcome to The Gliss.<p> 

<p>We're currently comprised of two members:</p>

<!-- TODO: Grid the two paragraphs below and add images of our faces -->

<p>Dawson Brown writes reviews for music of all kinds, and occasionally he’ll write opinion pieces too. He mainly does this for fun, but he also does it with the notion that someone is listening in, so in that sense he does it for you, the reader. He’ll attempt to write these fairly consistently but he's not the powerhouse that a site like pitchfork is, expect updates every other day or so, but come by often to see if that changes.<p>

<p>Brennan Brown (no relation) the website's developer, and occasionally does reviews himself. He's a trained saxophonist and has done music for a Visual Novel series entitled <a href="https://featherbent.com">Featherbent</a> and has released a few solo albums under the pseduonym <a href="https://augustin.bandcamp.com">Augustin</a>.</p>

<p>Although we’re primarily a music review site, we like to talk about the music scene and certain topics related to music. Usually I’ll try to do one each week but that could change as time goes on and new seasons approach.<p>

<p>You can contact us through the contact page, we’ll get back to you as quickly as we can.<p>

<p>Enjoy your time here at The Gliss.<p>
