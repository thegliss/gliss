<p>Welcome to Dawson Reviews! I write reviews for music of all kinds, and occasionally I’ll write opinion pieces too. I mainly do this for fun, but I also do it with the notion that someone is listening in, so in that sense I do it for you, the reader. I’ll attempt to write these fairly consistently but I’m not the powerhouse that a site like pitchfork is, expect bi-daily updates but come by often if that changes for any reason at all.<p>

<p>Although we’re primarily a music review site, I like to talk about the music scene and certain topics related to music. Usually I’ll try to do one each week but that could change as time goes on and new seasons approach.<p>

<p>You can contact me through the contact page, I’ll get back to you as quickly as I can.<p>

<p>Enjoy your time here at harmonik.co.<p>
